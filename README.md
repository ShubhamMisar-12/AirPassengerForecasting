# Air Passenger Data Forecasting with SARIMA

[Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shubhammisar/air-passenger-data-forecasting-sarima)

This project focuses on forecasting the number of passengers in an airline dataset using the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about the number of passengers in an airline over a certain period of time. The dataset can be found in the `Data` folder.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- statsmodels

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r Requirements.txt.txt
```

## File Structure

The file structure of this project repository is as follows:

- `Data/`: This folder contains the dataset file used in the project.

  - `AirPassengerDataForecasting-Sarima.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file for data preprocessing and SARIMA modeling.

- `LICENSE`: This file specifies the licensing terms for the project.

- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

- `Requirements.txt`: This file lists the dependencies required to run the project.

Please note that this structure assumes there are no additional files or folders in the repository. Make sure to adjust the file structure information if you have any additional files or folders in your specific project.
